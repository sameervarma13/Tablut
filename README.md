## The objective of the white pieces is to get the King piece to the edge of the board. 
## The black pieces try to capture the king before it reaches the edge. The 16 black pieces 
## start the game first. The white pieces, with the king at the center of the board, move next and 
## the two sides alternate turns. All pieces move chess rooks, any number of squares vertically or horizontally.
## No piece can occupy the same square as another piece and no piece can be 'jumped'. No piece other 
## than the kind may land on the middle square. There are several conditions for capturing an enemy but 
## the most common scenario occurs when an enemy's move results in the piece being enclosed on two opposite
## sides. A king is captured like any other piece except for when it is on the center piece or any of the four
## orthogonally adjacent squares. In this situation the king must be surrounded on all four sides by enemy pieces.
